Currently, there are on the internet and social media, recordings from subway security cameras that souldn't be there.
These recordings made by the "Sistema Colectivo Metro" (Subway from mexico city) are accessed by employees who are dedicated to supervising them. 
Unfortunately, some of these employees record these security cameras recordings with their smartphones.
Several times, these videos are leaked, and they affect in many ways. For example, this leaked videos attempt against the privacy of subway users, show the misuse of facilities, or they can even
interfere whith criminal investigations.

That's why we created a software to prevent employees from recording the security video monitors with their smartphone cameras.

A software that uses a trained neural network to identify, using a camera pointed at the employee, a smartphone infront of the monitor and, automaticly close the video player.

We also used cryptography and steganography in a video player made by us, to make it imposible for the employee to save or steal the video files.

See the video(it's in spanish) for a functional example and a better explanation.
